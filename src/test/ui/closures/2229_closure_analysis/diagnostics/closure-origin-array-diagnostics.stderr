error[E0525]: expected a closure that implements the `Fn` trait, but this closure only implements `FnOnce`

LL |     let c = || {
   |             ^^ this closure implements `FnOnce`, not `Fn`
LL |         let [_, _s] = s;
   |                       - closure is `FnOnce` because it moves the variable `s` out of its environment

LL |     expect_fn(c);
   |     --------- the requirement to implement `Fn` derives from here
