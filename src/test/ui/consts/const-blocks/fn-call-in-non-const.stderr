error[E0277]: the trait bound `Option<Bar>: Copy` is not satisfied
  --> $DIR/fn-call-in-non-const.rs:14:31

LL |     let _: [Option<Bar>; 2] = [no_copy(); 2];
   |                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `Copy` is not implemented for `Option<Bar>`
   |
   = help: the following implementations were found:
             <Option<T> as Copy>
   = note: the `Copy` trait is required because the repeated element will be copied
   = help: consider creating a new `const` item and initializing it with the result of the function call to be used in the repeat position, like `const VAL: Type = const_fn();` and `let x = [VAL; 42];`
   = help: create an inline `const` block, see RFC #2920 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2920> for more information
